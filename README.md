# deal_or_no_deal
Deal Or No Deal was a very popular game show. Even now, for a family party, it's a fun game to pass time. I made a code to play the game right in your terminal/console. This isn't made to be a game which can be installed by everyone and played, I just made it as a fun project as I just started out with python. So if you have python installed and wanna have some fun, or just curious to see how I did this, feel free to check the code out!
